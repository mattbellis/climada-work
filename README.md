Installed everything on Linux using the procedure detailed here.

However, using `conda` to create the virtual environment was taking forever, 
so I switched to `micromamba`.

I installed `micromamba` following these steps.

Then I followed [these steps](https://climada-python.readthedocs.io/en/stable/guide/install.html) except that
where it says `conda` I used `micromamba`.

After `micromamba` is installed, I added it to the `$PATH` variable in my `.bashrc`.
